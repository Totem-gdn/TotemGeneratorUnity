using TotemEntities;
using TotemEntities.DNA;
using TotemServices.DNA;

public class test : MonoBehaviour
{
    ///Id of your game
    ///Used for legacy records identification
    private string _gameId = "TotemDemo";

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        //Initialize TotemCore
        TotemCore totemCore = new TotemCore(_gameId);


        //Authenticate user through social login in web browser and get user's assets
        totemCore.AuthenticateCurrentUser((user) =>
        {
            //Check if login was canceled
            if (user == null)
            {
                return;
            }

            //Using default filter with a default avatar model. You can implement your own filters and/or models
            totemCore.GetUserAvatars<TotemDNADefaultAvatar>(user, TotemDNAFilter.DefaultAvatarFilter, (avatars) =>
            {
                foreach (var avatar in avatars)
                {

            Debug.Log("Legacy record created");
        });
